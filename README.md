# ML_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
A project I did using a data set from Kaggle. Used multiple ML models to detect credit card fraud, scored them and compared the to each other to find the best one.

The data set I used can be found on kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The models tested were: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine.

The model I chose to use was Logistic Regression because it has the highest accuracy.

I deployed the model using pickle and streamlit
